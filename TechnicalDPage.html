                 JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
                 It is a small and lightweight.Inside a host environment (for example,
                 a web browse), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment
                 to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Javascript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and
                    Math, and a core set of languageelements such as operators, control structures,
                    and statements.
                    Core Javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplement it with 
                    additional objects,for example:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-Side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            to control a browser and its Document Object Model(DOM).For example Client-Side
                            extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond user
                             events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core languge by supplying objects relevant to running 
                            JavaScripton a server.For example , Server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                            with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the appliction,
                            or perform file manipulations on a serve.

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>A geneal understanding of the internet and the World Wide web(WWWW)</li>
                        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language(HTML)</li>
                        <li>Some programming experience.If you are new to programming, try 
                            one of tutorials li,ked on the main page</li>

                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundementally Javascript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and
                    Math, and a core set of languageelements such as operators, control structures,
                    and statements.
                    Core Javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplement it with 
                    additional objects,for example:

        <div class="main-section" id="helloworld">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                Javascript code.
                 <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName){alert("Hello" + yourName);}
                    greetMe("world")
                 </code>
            </p>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>

        </div>
        <div class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br>
                    With the keyword var.For example,
                    <code>
                        var x = 42
                    </code>
                </p>  
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    By simply assignint it a value.For example,
                    <code>
                        x =13
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This always declare a global variable.It generates a strict JavaScript 
                    warning.You shouldn't use this variant.
                    <code>
                        let y = 13
                    </code>
                </p>
